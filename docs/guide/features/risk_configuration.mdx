# Risk Configuration Notification

When EMQX-Guard-Pro boots up, it performs a thorough scan of your configuration settings, 
looking for any potential risks. 
If it finds anything concerning, it sends you a friendly heads-up. 
It's like having a tech-savvy friend who gives you a nudge when something needs your attention.

Here are some key areas EMQX-Guard-Pro keeps an eye on:

## üç™ Default Cookie Alert:
    
Imagine leaving your house key under the doormat. 
If you're using the default cookie and your EMQX internal ports are exposed to the public internet, 
it's like inviting unwanted guests. 

EMQX-Guard-Pro warns you about this, helping you avoid potential malicious connections.

## üîê Authentication Check:

Think of authentication as the bouncer at an exclusive club. Without it, anyone can walk in.
EMQX-Guard-Pro lets you know if authentication is turned off, 
preventing a situation where any device could connect to your EMQX broker.

## üìù Log Level Optimization:
Too much of a good thing can be problematic. If your log level is set too low, 
it's like having a security camera that records every tiny detail 24/7. 
This can lead to performance issues due to excessive logging.
EMQX-Guard-Pro helps you find the right balance.

## üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard Security:
Using default passwords for your admin account is like using "password123" for your email. 
EMQX-Guard-Pro reminds you to change the default dashboard admin password, 
protecting you from potential attacks.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Authorization Source Checks:
EMQX-Guard-Pro also looks at your authorization settings:
    - If your authorization.sources is empty but the no_match policy is set to "allow", 
    it's like leaving your front door wide open. Any client could potentially connect to EMQX.
    - Conversely, if authorization.sources is empty and the no_match policy is set to "deny", 
    it's like locking everyone out. No clients would be able to connect to EMQX.
