# Alarms
EMQX provides a wide range of [Alarms](https://docs.emqx.com/en/emqx/latest/observability/alarms.html) information. 
 In the open-source version, users can receive alarm notifications by subscribing to system topics via MQTT Protocol. 
 To get real-time alarm notifications, you need to write an MQTT client to subscribe to these system topics.

:::tip
As of EMQX v5.8, alarm information is no longer displayed on the dashboard in the open-source version.
This makes EMQX-Guard-Pro more valuable for getting real-time alarm alerts.
:::

EMQX-Guard-Pro significantly enhances and expands the alarm features by:
- Enabling real-time notifications to various notification platforms
- Offering easy configuration without any coding required
- Adding more new alarm types 

If you have ideas for more useful alarm types, 
please feel free to open an [ISSUE](https://github.com/zhongwencool/get-emqx-guard-pro/issues).

Here are some examples of alarm notifications you might receive via email:
