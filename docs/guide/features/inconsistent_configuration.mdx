# Inconsistent Configuration Notification
EMQX tries to keep all nodes in a cluster configured the same way.
Sometimes, inconsistencies can occur for reasons beyond control.
For example, one node might connect to a webhook while another can't.
This can lead to ongoing problems with updates on the node that failed to connect.

EMQX-Guard-Pro keeps an eye on these inconsistencies and sends alerts.
This helps you spot which settings are different across all cluster nodes.

## How To Fix ?

Check the status of the cluster configuration synchronization

```
./bin/emqx_ctl conf cluster_sync status
```
Attempt to sync the node with the most comprehensive configuration to other nodes.

```
./bin/emqx_ctl conf cluster_sync fix 
```
:::tip
This `conf cluster_sync fix` command is available in EMQX v5.8 and later.
