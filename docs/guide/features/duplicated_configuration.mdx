# Duplicated Configuration Notification

:::note EMQX offers three ways to change configurations:

- Environment Variables `EMQX__MQTT__IDLE_TIMEOUT=30s`
- etc/emqx.conf file `mqtt.idle_timeout = 30s`
- Dashboard or Command line `emqx_ctl conf`

:::

Configuration priority at startup (highest to lowest):

```
Environment Variables > etc/emqx.conf > Dashboard/CLI
```

Duplicate configurations can lead to confusing behavior. For instance:

```
1️⃣. Set mqtt.idle_timeout to 30s in etc/emqx.conf
2️⃣. Change it to 60s via Dashboard
3️⃣. Current value is 60s
4️⃣. EMQX cluster restarts for some reason
5️⃣. Current value reverts to 30s (`etc/emqx.conf` overrides Dashboard when loading at startup)
```

To prevent confusion, it's recommended to use a single way for configuring each setting. 
This way ensures consistency and reduces the risk of conflicting configurations.

EMQX-Guard-Pro monitors for those duplicated configurations and alerts you when detected.

## Another Dangerous Scenario

Let's consider a common mistake:

import { Steps } from '@theme';

<Steps>
### Initial setup:

> Configure authorization in `etc/emqx.conf` to reject unauthorized clients. 
>
> This includes setting `deny_action = disconnect`, `no_match = deny`, and `sources = []`.

### Runtime change:

> Configure authorization's sources to `built_in_database` on Dashboard while EMQX is running. 
>
> System works as expected.

### Problem occurs:
> After a long runtime, the cluster restarts. 
>
> All clients are unable to log in because the authorization's sources is empty (in `etc/emqx.conf`).

### Solution:
> Avoid configuring `authorization.sources` in `etc/emqx.conf`. 
>
> Instead, configure `authorization.sources` through the Dashboard.

</Steps>

## How To Fix?

- Identify duplicated configurations.
- Remove these items from `etc/emqx.conf` file.
- Next time the cluster restarts, it will be normal.

## Best Practices

Use only one way to change each configuration item:

1️⃣. Set `node`, `cluster`, `dashboard` in `etc/emqx.conf` file

2️⃣. Set all other settings via Dashboard/CLI

3️⃣. Add to `etc/emqx.conf` file only if:
   - The setting is not available in Dashboard/CLI
   - The setting is not applicable for all nodes in the cluster
   - The setting is not intended to be changed at runtime

:::tip
EMQX's dashboard modifies configurations for the entire cluster.

For single node changes:
- Use `etc/emqx.conf` file
- Example: Set one node's `log.file.level=debug`, others to `log.file.level=warning` for temporary trace use.

This method is for temporary modifications only.

Long-term use can make configuration management difficult, 
and it always conflicts with the modifications made in the dashboard.
