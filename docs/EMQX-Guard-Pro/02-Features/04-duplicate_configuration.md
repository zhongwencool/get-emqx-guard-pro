# Duplicated Configuration Notification

EMQX offers three ways to modify its configuration:

- **Environment Variables:** Using the prefix `EMQX__`, for example: `EMQX__MQTT__IDLE_TIMEOUT=30s`
- **Configuration File:** Editing the `etc/emqx.conf` file, for example: `mqtt.idle_timeout = 30s`
- **Dashboard or Command Line Interface (CLI):** Utilizing the EMQX Dashboard or the `emqx_ctl conf` command.

Configuration priority at startup (highest to lowest):
```
Environment Variables > etc/emqx.conf > Dashboard/CLI
```

The presence of duplicate configurations can lead to unexpected and confusing behavior. Consider the following scenario:

```
1Ô∏è‚É£. You set mqtt.idle_timeout to 30s in the etc/emqx.conf file.
2Ô∏è‚É£. Later, you change this setting to 60s via the EMQX Dashboard.
3Ô∏è‚É£. Currently, the active value for mqtt.idle_timeout is 60s.
4Ô∏è‚É£. The EMQX cluster restarts due to some reason.
5Ô∏è‚É£. After the restart, the active value reverts to 30s because the configuration from etc/emqx.conf takes precedence over the Dashboard settings during startup.
```
To prevent such confusion and ensure predictable behavior, it is highly recommended to choose a single method for configuring each specific setting. This practice guarantees consistency and significantly reduces the risk of conflicting configurations.

emqx_guard_pro actively monitors for instances of duplicated configurations and will alert you upon detection.

## Another Potentially Hazardous Scenario

Let's examine another common pitfall related to duplicated configurations:

### Initial Setup:
You configure authorization rules in the `etc/emqx.conf` file to reject unauthorized clients.
This typically involves setting parameters like `deny_action = disconnect`, `no_match = deny`, and `sources = []`.

### Runtime Modification:
While EMQX is running, you modify the `authorization.sources` setting to `built_in_database` through the EMQX Dashboard.

At this point, the system functions as expected, and authorization is handled by the built-in database.

### The Problem Arises:
After a prolonged period of operation, the EMQX cluster undergoes a restart.

Upon restarting, all clients are suddenly unable to log in. This occurs because the `authorization.sources` setting in the `etc/emqx.conf` file is still empty (`sources = []`), and this configuration overrides the Dashboard setting during startup.

### Recommended Solution:

Avoid configuring the `authorization.sources` setting directly in the `etc/emqx.conf` file.

Instead, manage the `authorization.sources` setting exclusively through the EMQX Dashboard.

## How To Fix ?

- **Identify Duplicated Configurations:** Carefully review your EMQX configuration settings across environment variables, the `etc/emqx.conf` file, and the Dashboard/CLI. Look for instances where the same configuration item is defined in multiple locations.
- **Remove from `etc/emqx.conf`:** Once identified, remove the duplicated configuration items from the `etc/emqx.conf` file.
- **Restart the Cluster:** After removing the duplicated entries, restart the EMQX cluster. The configuration will now be loaded correctly based on the defined priority.

## Best Practices for EMQX Configuration Management

To maintain a clean and manageable EMQX configuration, adhere to the following best practices:

1Ô∏è‚É£. **Define Core Node, Cluster, and Dashboard Settings in `etc/emqx.conf`:** Configure fundamental settings related to the EMQX node itself (e.g., node name), cluster formation, and Dashboard access within the `etc/emqx.conf` file.

2Ô∏è‚É£. **Manage Most Other Settings via Dashboard/CLI:** Utilize the EMQX Dashboard or the `emqx_ctl` command-line interface for configuring the majority of other settings. This approach allows for dynamic updates without requiring server restarts for many parameters.

3Ô∏è‚É£. **Use `etc/emqx.conf` Only When Necessary:** Limit the use of `etc/emqx.conf` to specific scenarios where:
   - The desired setting is not available for modification through the Dashboard or CLI.
   - The setting is inherently specific to individual nodes within the cluster and should not be applied cluster-wide.
   - The setting is not intended to be changed frequently at runtime.

:::tip
The EMQX Dashboard applies configuration changes across the entire cluster.

For making configuration changes that are specific to a single node, you can utilize the `etc/emqx.conf` file.

For example, you might temporarily set the log level of a single node to `debug` (`log.file.level=debug`) while keeping other nodes at `log.file.level=warning` for temporary tracing purposes.

**Important Note:** This method of using `etc/emqx.conf` for single-node changes should be considered a temporary solution. Long-term reliance on this approach can complicate configuration management and may lead to conflicts with configurations managed through the Dashboard.
